Consider compressing the output of a previous compression (you may use the ‘zip’
command). Start from any object, for instance some part T of the present text.
Quite probably, Zn(T) will end up increasing. It is easy to see that either the
sequence Zn(T) is periodic or one can extract an increasing subsequence from it.
Indicate the successive compression sizes. Verify that for some n0, Zn0(T) >
length(T). 
(give the values)
